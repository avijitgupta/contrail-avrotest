Version v1.0.2
--------------
Fixed bugs:
1. In combine function in combineReads.c: modified selection of the base when quality values of bases are the same. Instead of random selection of the base, first check whether any base is "N" to avoid selection of "N" if not necessary.

Added options for easier handling of the program:
1. Added error messages in case no input files and no parameters are specified.
2. Added the parameter to print 'help' for running the program.
3. Added the option to specify prefix of the output files.
4. Added the option to specify directory of the output files.
	
Functional changes:
1. Changed read length to 170.
2. Automatic calculation of maximum overlap length given average read length, average fragment length, and fragment standard deviation.
	
	
Version v1.0.1
--------------
Fixed bugs:
1. In align_position function in combineReads.c: added the line *score=10001 when readLength2 < overlap.
2. idSet function in utilities.c: added the part of the condition to end reading the line of file1[0] if '\n' is found.
